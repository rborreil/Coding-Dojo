        /*As youâ€™re a very friendly person, you would like to send a birthday note to all the friends you have. But you have a lot of friends and a bit lazy, it may take some times to write all the notes by hand. The good news is that computers can do it automatically for you. 
        
        Imagine you have a flat file with all your friends and you want to send them a happy birthday email on their birth date.
        
        How would this software look like ? Try to implement it so you can easily change :
            1 - the way you retrieve the friends data (for instance, try switching to a SQLite Db)
            2 - the way you send the note : (for instance, imagine you want to send SMS instead of emails)

        What kind of tests would you write ? Would you use Mocks ? */
